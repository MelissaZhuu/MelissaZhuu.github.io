                <h2>about me</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate software developer who loves good design, good movies and good food.
                    I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Design from Queen's University and have some experience
                    building websites for small buisnesses, non profit organizations and personal passion projects. 
                    I'm always curious about things I don't know yet, and strive to learn new front-end tools and technologies 
                    to stay up to date and to continuously grow as a developer. I've been actively involved in both the design and 
                    sofware development processes and get excited seeing cool designs and ideas come to life. 
                    I love a good user experience, and believe that understanding design is crucial in software development.
                    I have lots of experience creating user friendly mockups and prototypes in Figma, along with completing a certificate 
                    from a UX bootcamp during the pandemic. When I'm not coding, I'm gaming, playing badminton or looking for the next
                    delicious food place to try out!

                    <h2 class="title">Frontend Mentor</h2>
                    <p> Despite web development not being a prominent focus area in my computer science degree, I found a love for it
                        after joining a web dev club at school and helping some real-world clients build full stack websites.
                        
                        Although I've learned enough to create full blown web apps, I wanted to take some time to go back and solidify my 
                        fundamentals, while filling in some knowledge gaps, and learning useful tricks I might have missed over the years.
                        
                        Frontend Mentor is a site I came across that has project briefs and designs to help developers 
                        practice their frontend skills and give them project ideas. I was able to accurately recreate several 
                        of these designs by translating JPG images and design files into interactive components. I did so using 
                        HTML, CSS, Sass/Scss, and JavaScript, as well as applying frontend concepts like responsive and mobile-first 
                        development, responsive images, and coding best practices. Below are a few challenges that I completed 
                        from the Frontend Mentor site, along with a link to my profile.

                        <h3>QR Code Component</h3>
                        <img>
                        <p>This is a simple card component that features a QR code. I used HTML and vanilla CSS to build it.
                            This project allowed me to practice with CSS positioning and Flexbox, and I was able to make it responsive 
                            by using relative units.

                        <p>This project was a preview card for blog articles, and I used HTML, CSS and the Sass/Scss preprocessor to build it. 
                            I struggled with the notorious newbie issue of centering a div and learned that elements had default padding and margins
                            which I resolved by starting my stylesheets by setting them to 0.

                            mobile and desktop design. I built it with HTML, CSS and continued to practice using Sass. I was also able to make this 
                            solution responsive across different screen sizes.

                            CSS and Sass. For this project, I implemented a mobile-first approach and a responsive solution that works and looks good on 
                            different screen sizes. I learned how to style tables, list elements and pseudo-elements.

                            CSS and Sass along with Flexbox and Grid for this solution. I learned a lot about responsive images and srcset in this project, 
                            as well as CSS Grid.

                            Flexbox and Grid for this solution, which allowed me to gain a better understanding of both.

                        <p>This is a testimonial spread commonly found on other websites offering products or services. The main focus of this project was on 
                            flexible layout and responsiveness. I used HTML, CSS, Sass, Flexbox and Grid for this solution and was able to get it looking really 
                            nice on all screen sizes. Additional to the mobile and desktop designs, I took it upon myself to create a tablet version as I felt 
                            that the transition between larger mobile and smaller desktop screen sizes to be awkward. It turned out really well and the media 
                            queries flow seamlessly as the screen size grows and shrinks. I was also able to clean up my code, keeping it organized and avoiding 
                            any repetitive code by taking advantage of Sass's features.

                            advanced challenges that require more user interaction, thus calling for more JavaScript. I plan to also use TypeScript and React to fill in any 
                            knowledge gaps and discover new interesting features that I may not have had the chance to explore previously. I also plan on learning more 
                            about NextJS, Node, incorporating backend APIs and databases, animation and video, Flutter and Go in future endevours.

                        environmental condition inputs. This was a full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS 
                        and NodeJS). TypeScript was used as the main development language and RESTful API calls handled the backend logic. 
                        I also used Figma for the initial design of the website's information architecture, user experience and 
                        various wireframes and prototypes during the collaboration with the client. Git was the main form of version control.

                        JavaScript and ReactJS. Figma was also used for the inital design of page layout and prototypes to show the 
                        client, and Git was the version control system used in this project.

                        on a guide for a cute sleep tracking game developed by the Pokemon franchise. This mobile game appears simple, but has many 
                        nuances and tricks that can be difficult to pick up on as a new player, so I've compiled a bunch of data and personal research 
                        that I found helpful, and I'm turning it into a planner/guide for players to use.
